## Introduction & Basic Concepts

### What is Mode of Operation?

The Q-Drives controller behavior depends on the activated mode of operation. The device may implement several modes of operation. Since it is not possible to operate the modes in parallel, the user is able to activate the required function by selecting a mode of operation. The control device writes to the modes of operation object <strong>(6060h)</strong> in order to select the operation mode. The drive device provides the modes of operation display object <strong>(6061h)</strong> to indicate the actual activated operation mode. Controlword, statusword, and set-points are used mode-specific. This implies the responsibility of the control device to avoid inconsistencies and erroneous behavior. The switching between the modes of operation implies no automatic reconfiguration of COBs for real-time data transmission. Therefore, the PDS may limit mode switching in one or some PDS FSA state(s). Mode switching may also be limited to the 'local control' function; this means it is not possible to select the operation mode via the network.

**Important Notes:**
- Mode changes typically require the device to be in Pre-operational state
- Not all modes may be supported on every device variant
- Check object 6502h to verify available modes before attempting to switch

## Homing Mode - Mode 6

### Description
Establish absolute position reference using various homing methods.

### Use Cases
- Finding machine zero position
- Establishing absolute coordinate system
- Initial positioning after power-up

### Common Homing Methods
| Method | Description                      |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| -1/-2  | Negative/Positive Mechanical Limit |
| 17/18  | Negative/Positive Limit Switch     |
| 19/20  | Positive Home Switch              |
| 21/22  | Negative Home Switch              |
| 37     | Homing Current Position          |

### Method -1/-2: Negative/Positive Mechanical Limit
![Homing](Homing_1.png)
With this method, as shown in Figure 1, the direction of movement is negative until the mechanical end stop is reached. When a predefined current threshold is exceeded, the homing position is reached, and the position is set as the homing position.
![Homing](Homing_2.png)
With this method, as shown in Figure 2, the direction of movement is positive until the mechanical end stop is reached. When a predefined current threshold is exceeded, the homing position is reached, and the position is set as the homing position.

### Method 17/18: Negative/Positive Limit
![Homing](Homing_17.png)
Using this method as shown in Figure 3, the initial direction of movement shall be leftward if
the negative limit switch is inactive (here: low). The home position shall be at the first homing pulse to the right of the position where the negative limit switch becomes inactive.
![Homing](Homing_18.png)
Using this method as shown in Figure 4, the initial direction of movement shall be rightward if
the positive limit switch is inactive (here: low). The position of home shall be at the first homing pulse to the left of the position where the positive limit switch becomes inactive.

### Method 19/20: Positive Home Switch
![Homing](Homing_19_20.png)
Using this method as shown in Figure 5, the initial direction of movement shall be dependent on the state of the home switch. If the initial position is situated so that the direction of movement shall reverse during homing, the point at which the reversal takes place is anywhere after a change of state of the home switch.

### Method 21/22: Negative Home Switch
![Homing](Homing_21_22.png)
Using this method as shown in Figure 6, the initial direction of movement shall be dependent on the state of the home switch. If the initial
position is situated so that the direction of movement shall reverse during homing, the point at
which the reversal takes place is anywhere after a change of state of the home switch.

### Method 37: Homing Current Position
![Homing](Homing_37.png)
Using this method as shown in Figure 7, the position of home shall be at the initial position.
