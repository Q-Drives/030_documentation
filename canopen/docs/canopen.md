## Physical Layer & Network Setup

### CAN Bus Topology

CAN operates as a 2-wire bus system where all participants are connected in parallel. The bus uses differential signaling to achieve excellent noise immunity in industrial environments.

#### Network Architecture

```
node 1    node 2    ...    node n
  |         |               |
  |---------|---------------|
           CAN Bus Line
```

**Key Requirements:** <br>
- **Parallel Connection**: All devices connect to the same two-wire bus <br>
- **Differential Signaling**: CAN_H and CAN_L provide robust communication <br>
- **Linear Topology**: Avoid star configurations or loops <br>
- **Proper Termination**: Essential for signal integrity <br>

### Network Termination

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirement**
> 
> The CAN bus **must** be terminated with 120Œ© resistors at both ends, regardless of cable length. This termination prevents signal reflections that can cause communication errors.

**Termination Rules:** <br>
- ‚úÖ **Required**: 120Œ© termination at each end of the bus <br>
- ‚úÖ **Always Needed**: Even for very short cable lengths <br>
- ‚ùå **Never**: Terminate stub lines or intermediate connections <br>
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Use precision resistors (1% tolerance recommended) <br>

### Bus Length Limitations

The maximum bus length is primarily limited by signal propagation delay. The CAN multi-master arbitration process requires that signals arrive at all nodes quasi-simultaneously (before sampling within a bit time).

#### Standard Bus Length Specifications

| Baud Rate | Maximum Bus Length | Typical Application |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **1 Mbit/s** | < 20m | High-speed local networks |
| **500 kbit/s** | < 100m | Standard industrial networks |
| **250 kbit/s** | < 250m | Medium-range applications |
| **125 kbit/s** | < 500m | Extended industrial networks |
| **50 kbit/s** | < 1000m | Long-distance applications |
| **20 kbit/s** | < 2500m | Very long networks |
| **10 kbit/s** | < 5000m | Maximum distance applications |

> **üìù Note**: Literature often states 40m for 1 Mbit/s networks. However, this doesn't apply to networks with optically isolated CAN controllers. Worst-case calculations with optocouplers yield 5m at 1 Mbit/s, though 20m is typically achievable in practice.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: For bus lengths over 1000m, CAN repeaters may be necessary to maintain signal integrity.

### Stub Lines (Drop Lines)

Stub lines are short cable branches that connect individual devices to the main bus line. While they can cause signal reflections, they are generally acceptable when properly designed.

#### Stub Line Guidelines

Reflections from stub lines are typically uncritical if they settle completely before the sampling point. With standard bit timing settings used in bus couplers, the following stub line lengths are permissible:

| Baud Rate | Max Single Stub Length | Max Total Stub Length |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **1 Mbit/s** | < 1m | < 5m |
| **500 kbit/s** | < 5m | < 25m |
| **250 kbit/s** | < 10m | < 50m |
| **125 kbit/s** | < 20m | < 100m |
| **50 kbit/s** | < 50m | < 250m |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Stub lines must never be terminated with resistors.

### Multiport Taps

When using passive multiport distributors, shorter stub line lengths must be maintained to ensure proper signal integrity.

#### Multiport Tap Specifications

| Baud Rate | Max Stub Length (Multiport) | Max Trunk Line Length |
|-----------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **1 Mbit/s** | < 0.3m | < 25m |
| **500 kbit/s** | < 1.2m | < 66m |
| **250 kbit/s** | < 2.4m | < 120m |
| **125 kbit/s** | < 4.8m | < 310m |

### Cable Requirements

Proper cable selection is crucial for reliable CAN communication.

#### Recommended Cable Specifications

**Primary Requirements:** <br>
- **Cable Type**: Twisted pair, shielded (2x2 conductors) <br>
- **Characteristic Impedance**: 108-132 Œ© <br>
- **Shield**: Overall screen for EMI protection <br>
- **Conductor**: Minimum 0.25 mm¬≤ cross-section <br>

**Optional Considerations:** <br>
- **CAN Ground Connection**: Second pair can be omitted for small networks with common power supply <br>
- **Cable Length**: Consider voltage drop for power-over-bus applications <br>
- **Environmental Rating**: Select appropriate jacket material for installation environment <br>

## CANopen Communication Model

### Device Model Overview

CANopen consists of a protocol definition (communication profile) and device profiles that standardize data content for specific device classes. This layered approach ensures interoperability between devices from different manufacturers.

**Architecture Components:** <br>
- **Communication Profile**: Protocol definition and message formats <br>
- **Device Profiles**: Standardized data content for device classes <br>
- **Object Dictionary**: Structured parameter and data storage <br>
- **Communication Objects**: Different message types for various purposes <br>

### Object Dictionary Structure

The CANopen device parameters and process data are organized in an Object Dictionary, providing structured access to all device functionality.

**Object Dictionary Features:** <br>
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Objects organized by index and sub-index <br>
- **Standardized Access**: Uniform method for parameter configuration <br>
- **Data Type Definition**: Consistent data representation across devices <br>
- **Access Control**: Read-only, write-only, and read-write permissions <br>

> **üìñ Reference**: For complete Object Dictionary details, see [Object Dictionary](object-dictionary.md)

### Communication Types

CANopen defines several communication types for input and output data (Process Data Objects):

#### Event-Driven Communication
- **Behavior**: Messages sent immediately when data changes
- **Advantage**: Efficient bandwidth usage, immediate response
- **Use Case**: Status changes, alarm conditions, sporadic data
- **Characteristic**: Only changes transmitted, not continuous polling

#### Cyclic Synchronous Communication
- **Behavior**: SYNC message triggers synchronized data exchange
- **Advantage**: Deterministic timing, coordinated network behavior  
- **Use Case**: Real-time control applications, coordinated motion
- **Characteristic**: All devices synchronized to common time base

#### Polled Communication (On-Demand)
- **Behavior**: Data transmitted only when specifically requested
- **Advantage**: Full master control over communication timing
- **Use Case**: Diagnostic data, configuration parameters
- **Characteristic**: Client-server model with explicit requests

### Transmission Types

The desired communication type is configured using the **Transmission Type** parameter in PDO configuration objects.

**Configuration Values:** <br>
- **0**: SYNC-triggered (synchronous) <br>
- **1-240**: SYNC with event counter <br>
- **254**: Asynchronous event-driven <br>
- **255**: Asynchronous polled/on-demand <br>

## CANopen Objects & Services

### Network Management (NMT)

Network Management follows a master-slave structure requiring one CANopen device to assume the role of CANopen Master, with all other devices operating as NMT Slaves.

**Network Roles:** <br>
- **NMT Master**: Controls network startup, state transitions, error handling <br>
- **NMT Slaves**: Respond to master commands, report status, execute state changes <br>
- **Node Addressing**: Each slave has unique Node-ID in range [1..127] <br>

**NMT Services Enable:** <br>
- Device initialization and startup sequencing <br>
- Operational state control and monitoring   <br>
- Device reset and error recovery procedures <br>
- Network-wide coordination and synchronization <br>

> **üìñ Reference**: For detailed NMT information, see [Network Management](network-management.md)

### Service Data Objects (SDO)

A Service Data Object enables read and write access to the Object Dictionary, providing the primary method for device configuration and parameter access.

**SDO Communication Model:** <br>
- **Server**: Owner of the Object Dictionary (typically the device being configured) <br>
- **Client**: CAN node requesting data or initiating writes (typically the master) <br>
- **Upload**: Reading a value from the Object Dictionary <br> 
- **Download**: Writing a value to the Object Dictionary <br>

**Key Features:** <br>
- **Confirmed Service**: Every request receives a response <br>
- **Segmented Transfer**: Large data objects transferred in multiple segments <br>
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error codes for troubleshooting <br>
- **Security**: Access permissions enforced at object level <br>

### Process Data Objects (PDO)

A message containing only process data is called a "Process Data Object" (PDO). PDOs are designed for data that must be exchanged cyclically or in real-time.

**PDO Concept:** <br>
- **Efficient Transfer**: No overhead information (index, sub-index, length) <br>
- **Mapping Configuration**: Source and destination defined in separate PDO mapping <br>
- **Real-Time Capability**: Optimized for time-critical applications <br>
- **Multiple Mappings**: Up to 8 independent PDO configurations supported <br>

#### PDO Usage Requirements

PDOs can only be used when the NMT state machine is in "Operational" state. PDO configuration must be performed in "Pre-Operational" state.

**PDO Configuration:** <br>
- **Receive PDOs**: Configure processing of incoming PDO messages <br>
- **Transmit PDOs**: Configure transmission of outgoing PDO messages <br>
- **Mapping Flexibility**: Each PDO can carry up to 8 bytes (64 bits) of data <br>
- **Data Combination**: Multiple data types can be combined in single PDO <br>

**Example Combinations:**
- Two UNSIGNED32 values <br>
- One UNSIGNED32 + one UNSIGNED8 value <br>
- Custom combinations up to 8-byte limit <br>

### Synchronization Object (SYNC)

The Synchronization Object enables simultaneous validation of PDO data for all devices on the bus, ensuring coordinated network behavior.

**SYNC Operation:** <br>
- **Timing Master**: One device generates SYNC messages <br>
- **Network Coordination**: All devices synchronize to SYNC timing <br>
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures simultaneous input/output updates <br>
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Critical for real-time control applications <br>

### Time Stamp Object (TIME)

The Time-Stamp object provides network-wide time synchronization for applications requiring coordinated timing.

**Standard Time Format:** <br>
- **Resolution**: Milliseconds after midnight (32-bit field) <br>
- **Date Reference**: Days since January 1, 1984 (16-bit field) <br>
- **Overflow**: System resets on June 7, 2163 <br>

**High-Resolution Option:** <br>
For time-critical applications requiring microsecond accuracy: <br>
- **Resolution**: 1 microsecond (32-bit unsigned) <br>
- **Reset Interval**: Counter resets every 72 minutes <br>
- **Use Case**: Precise synchronization in large networks with reduced transmission rates <br>

### Emergency Object (EMCY)

An Emergency message is sent whenever an error occurs in the controller that is not caused by SDO access. This service is unconfirmed and transmitted with CAN-ID 80h + Node-ID.

**Emergency Characteristics:** <br>
- **Automatic Transmission**: Sent immediately when errors occur <br>
- **Unconfirmed Service**: No acknowledgment required <br>
- **Standard CAN-ID**: 0x80 + Node-ID for consistent identification <br>
- **Error Classification**: Provides specific error codes and additional information <br>
